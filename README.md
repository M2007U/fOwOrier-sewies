# 💫 fOwOrier Sewies // Fourier Series Visualizer
Fourier Series is a mathematical graph that is made by the sum of a series of rotating vectors, each with their rotation speed, initial direction, and amplitude.
for more information about Fourier Series, an HTML article is available on the Website : https://memo2007ultra.wixsite.com/m27u-l2016/foworier-sewies

# ✨ Features
*these features are available on our Website, partially available on GitHubPage*
- A huge canvas for the rendered result and the looping animation
- Settings are categorized into 4 pages :
  - Harmonics : this is where the user can set the parameters of the spinning vectors
  - Misc : contains settings unable to be categorized
  - Physics : defines how trails moves *(there are 3 types of trails : Tracing Trail, Coordinate Trail, and Wiping Trail)*
  - Visuals : let's the user define the colors of the graph *(most WebApps don't let you do this)*
- 12 presets

# 🪴 Process and BackStory

FOwOrier Sewies is originally implemented in one of XR_XharpRazor's VRChat World : Dimension Structure - A07:R06 - Kontainer
Some of his friends are intrigued by the visuals and interactions, however the only way to play with it is by hoping onto VR. 
On 2025-09-01, XR_XharpRazor decided to bring fOwOrier Sewies from Unity into HTML, and here we have it.

and guess what ? The entire process is streamed on Twitch
the link of the VOD is available on the Website : https://memo2007ultra.wixsite.com/m27u-l2016/foworier-sewies
